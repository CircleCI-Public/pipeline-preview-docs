# Preview of Pipeline Variables

## BEFORE YOU START: IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER
The documentation here is currently only a preview. You may use it at will, but this evaluation product is not yet fully supported or considered generally available. While we generally avoid breaking builds once a feature is in use, until the features discussed herein are taken out of preview we could make breaking changes. We will generally try to contact anyone using a preview feature who might encounter a breaking change but want you to be aware of the heightened risk of using preview software.

Use of the features herein as long as this notice is in the master branch (current as of August 2019) is done at your own risk and is governed by CircleCIâ€™s Terms of Service.

PREVIEWS ARE PROVIDED "AS-IS," "WITH ALL FAULTS," AND "AS AVAILABLE," AND ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS AND LIMITED WARRANTY. Previews may not be covered by customer support. Previews may be subject to reduced or different security, compliance and privacy commitments, as further explained in the Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and any additional notices provided with the Preview. We may change or discontinue Previews at any time without notice. We also may choose not to release a Preview into "General Availability."
