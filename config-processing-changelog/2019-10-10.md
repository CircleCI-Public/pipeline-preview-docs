# Upcoming changes to v2.1 config processing
October 10, 2019

Config processing is an area where small changes can have a large impact across
our customer base. We do our best, through extensive unit, functional, and
regression testing to make sure that we don't break config processing. But
sometimes we find bugs where the implementation is not conforming to
specification and our regression testing tells us that there are people who
will be affected by the bug fixes.

* Fixed a bug where a `false` default value for a parameter would prevent the
  default value being type-checked against the parameter's declared type.
  Parameter declarations like the following will no longer be accepted.
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    my-job:
      parameters:
        foo:
          type: string
          default: false
      steps:
        - ...
  ```
  An error will be reported instead:
  ```
  Error in definition of job 'my-job'
  Parameter error: default value of parameter 'foo' is 'false' (type boolean): expected type string
  ```

* Fixed a bug where a `null` default value for a parameter were accepted as
  valid defaults. Parameters declared with a `null` default value will always
  need to be passed in invocations, the following will no longer be accepted:
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    my-job:
      parameters:
        foo:
          type: string
          default:
      steps:
       - ...

  workflows:
    my-workflow:
      jobs:
        - my-job  # this will error, the `foo` parameter must be passed
  ```
  An error will be reported:
  ```
  Error calling workflow: 'my-workflow'
  Error calling job: 'my-job'
  Missing required argument(s): foo"
  ```

* The compiler is stricter about passing extra arguments that don't match
  formal parameters to jobs/executors/commands. Invocations like the following
  will no longer be accepted:
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    my-job:
      machine: true
      steps:
        - run: echo hello

  workflows:
    my-workflow:
      jobs:
        - my-job:
            unknown_arg: "hi" # this will error, `unknown_arg` is not a formal parameter for my-job
  ```
  An error will be reported instead:
  ```
  Error calling workflow: 'my-workflow'
  Error calling job: 'my-job'
  Unexpected argument(s): unknown_arg
  ```
